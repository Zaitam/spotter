# Spotter

Spotter is a productivity tool, the main function is to search and launch external application actions and applications themselves. (e.g. switch the next song or set a timer...) so you can stay focused on your current task. Kind of Spotlight or Alfred alternative.

* ❤️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Open source</b>
* 🤖&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Native</b>
* 🔌&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plugin system</b>
* ⌨️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Custom hotkeys</b>

<hr />

The main idea:

* 🔮&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide an api on the native level
* ⚛️&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React app uses it and implements various plugins<br>
It will allow the application to remain native and be available for developing javascript/typescript plugins.
