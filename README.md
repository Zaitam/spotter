# Spotter

Spotter is a productivity tool, the main function is to search and launch external application actions and applications themselves. (e.g. switch the next song or set a timer...) so you can stay focused on your current task. Kind of Spotlight or Alfred alternative.

## The main idea

* üîÆ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide an api on the native level
* ‚öõÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React app uses it and implements various plugins

It will allow the application to remain native and be available for developing javascript/typescript plugins.
